# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Blackjack card counting trainer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A python game that helps people improve their card counting and Blackjack skills and is displayed by turtle

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will simulate a Blackjack game using turtle and calculate the best possible moves (hit, stand, etc) and keep a card counting counter. The user can choose to display what they should've done after their move or request the current card count to help improve their skills.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make a blackjack simulator that keeps a count that a card counter would keep.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can add the mathematically best move the user should make.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to add animations, a bet system, and more statistics.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn to simulate a Blackjack game using turtle and learn about Blackjack and card counting. I will focus on making the simulation and my classmate will focus on the card counting.

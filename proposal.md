Gym Notes

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An android app that tracks gym information such as exercises, sets, weight, etc. It will also let them start a session to track how they're doing in that workout

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will behave like a notes app, the user can edit their workouts, start a session and input how much weight and reps they did.
